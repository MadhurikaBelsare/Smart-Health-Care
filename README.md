**1. Introduction :**

Smart Health Care is a website that predicts the disease of the user with respect to the symptoms given by the user. The Smart Health Care system has data sets collected from different health related sites. With the help of Smart Health Care the user will be able to know the probability of the disease with the given symptoms. This project will help to predict seven different types of disease such as Liver, Kidney, Heart, Parkinson, Covid-19, Malaria, Diabetes , Pneumonia and Lung Cancer  on a single platform.

**4. Model Architecture :**

**What is CNN?**

Convolutional Neural networks are specialized deep neural networks which can process the data that has input shape like a 2D matrix. Images are easily represented as a 2D matrix and CNN is very useful in working with images.
